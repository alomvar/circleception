# Circleception #

I was toying around with Affinity Designer when I got the idea of arranging circles in a circle. I did not know about any possible way how to distribute them in a close to perfect circle. Further the amount of work to try out different variants appeared way too much to me. It was a nice thought to just have sliders for quickly achieving different results.

No doubt, in the time I was writing this app I could have done everything by hand. Multiple times, probably. However it appeared as a good opportunity to practice my Swift. That also implicates that the solutions I found may not be the most elegant. I am open for suggestions all time.
